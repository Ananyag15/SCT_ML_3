*Cats vs Dogs Classifier - A deep learning project that teaches a computer to tell the difference between cats and dogs from images.
*Overview:
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. It’s built as a beginner-friendly but practical introduction to computer vision and image classification.
*Features:
1.Image classification (Cat 🐱 or Dog 🐶)
2.CNN model trained on real dataset
3.Accuracy & loss visualization
4.Test on your own images
5.Tech Stack
6.Python
7.TensorFlow / Keras
8.NumPy & Matplotlib
9.Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
